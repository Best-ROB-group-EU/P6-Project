# P6-Project
This repository is the software part, of the 6th semester project, for the Baschelor in Robotics at Aalborg University.
The project is titled Autonomous Sidewalk Inspection.
The software plans a path for a Boston Dynamics Spot robot, in order to follow a sidewalk, while an Intel Realsense D435 stereo camera captures RGB-D data in order to search for both sidewalk depressions and tile displacements.
