# P6-Project
This repository is the software part, of the 6th semester project, for the Baschelor in Robotics at Aalborg University.
The project is titled Autonomous Sidewalk Inspection.
The software planns a path for a spot robot, in order to fallow a sidewalk, while an intel realsense D435 stereo camera captures RGB-D data in order to search for both sidewalk depressions and tiles displacement.
